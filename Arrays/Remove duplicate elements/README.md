# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array â€“ Detailed Explanation

This code snippet demonstrates how to remove duplicates from a sorted array **in-place**. The function `removeDuplicate` processes the array, ensuring that the first `k` elements (where `k` is returned by the function) contain only unique values. The goal is to update the array without using additional space for another array.

## Code Listing

```python
nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
# The function will return k, the count of unique elements

def removeDuplicate(nums):
    pointer, writer = 0, 1  # pointer for iterating, writer for placing unique elements
    size = len(nums)
    
    while pointer < size - 1:
        # If current element is not equal to the next, it's a unique value
        if nums[pointer] != nums[pointer + 1]:
            nums[writer] = nums[pointer + 1]  # write the unique element at the writer index
            writer += 1  # move the writer to the next position
        pointer += 1  # always move the pointer to the next element
    
    return writer  # writer now represents the count of unique elements

n = removeDuplicate(nums)
print("output : ", end="")
for i in range(n):
    print(nums[i], ",", end="")
print("\nExpected : 0,1,2,3,4")
```

## Detailed Explanation

### Overview

- **Input:**  
  A sorted list `nums` that may contain duplicate values.
- **Output:**  
  The function returns an integer `k`, representing the number of unique elements. After running the function, the first `k` elements in `nums` are the unique values in sorted order.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Pointer Initialization:**
   - Two pointers are initialized:
     - **`pointer`** is set to `0` and is used to iterate over the array.
     - **`writer`** is set to `1` and indicates the next position in `nums` where a unique element should be placed.
   - **`size`** holds the length of the array, calculated using `len(nums)`.

2. **Iteration and Comparison:**
   - A `while` loop runs as long as `pointer < size - 1`. This condition ensures that the current element and its immediate neighbor can be compared.
   - Inside the loop:
     - **Comparison:**  
       The code checks if `nums[pointer]` is not equal to `nums[pointer + 1]`. Because the array is sorted, duplicates will always be adjacent.
     - **Action on Finding a Unique Element:**  
       If the current element is different from the next one, the unique element `nums[pointer + 1]` is copied to the position indicated by `writer`. The `writer` pointer is then incremented.
     - The `pointer` is always incremented to move through the array.

3. **Return Value:**
   - When the loop finishes, `writer` holds the count of unique elements found. This value is returned and stored in `n`.
   - The main part of the program then prints out the first `n` elements from `nums`, which are the unique values.

### Why This Approach Works

- **Sorted Array Assumption:**
  - Since the input array is already sorted, duplicates appear consecutively. This makes it straightforward to compare adjacent elements and identify unique values.
  
- **In-Place Modification:**
  - Using the `writer` pointer allows the algorithm to overwrite duplicates without requiring extra space for another array.
  
- **Efficiency:**
  - The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for this type of problem.

## Other Important Info

### Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **`len()` Function:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Computes the number of elements in a list.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Determines the size of the input array, which is used to control the loop iterations.

- **Pointers (Indexing):**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Pointers (or index variables) are used to keep track of positions in the array.
  - **Use Case:**  
    - `pointer`: Iterates over the array to check elements.
    - `writer`: Indicates where to write the next unique element.
  - **Benefit:**  
    This technique allows for in-place updates, which minimizes additional memory usage.

- **While Loop:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Repeatedly executes the block of code as long as a condition is true.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Continues the process of comparing each element with its neighbor until the end of the array is reached.
