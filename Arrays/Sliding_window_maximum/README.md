# Sliding Window Maximum – Detailed Explanation

This code snippet finds the maximum element in every contiguous subarray (or window) of size `k` within the input list `nums`. The solution leverages a **deque** to efficiently track potential maximums as the window slides across the array.

## Code Listing

```python
from collections import deque

nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
k = 3
# Expected Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]

def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    if not nums:
        return []
    
    results = []
    index_q = deque()  # This deque will store indices of elements, maintaining a decreasing order of values
    
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Remove indices that are out of the current window
        if index_q and index_q[0] < index - k + 1:
            index_q.popleft()
        
        # Remove indices whose corresponding values are less than the current number
        while index_q and nums[index_q[-1]] < num:
            index_q.pop()
        
        # Add current index to the deque
        index_q.append(index)
        
        # Once we have processed k elements, add the current maximum to the results
        if index >= k - 1:
            results.append(nums[index_q[0]])
    
    return results

print("output:", maxSlidingWindow(nums, k))
```

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Overview

- **Objective:**  
  For each sliding window of size `k` in the array `nums`, determine the maximum value within that window.
  
- **Example:**  
  For `nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, the windows and their maximums are:
  - `[1, 3, -1]` → Maximum is `3`
  - `[3, -1, -3]` → Maximum is `3`
  - `[-1, -3, 5]` → Maximum is `5`
  - `[-3, 5, 3]` → Maximum is `5`
  - `[5, 3, 6]` → Maximum is `6`
  - `[3, 6, 7]` → Maximum is `7`
  
  Hence, the expected output is `[3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]`.

### 2. Using the Deque

A deque (double-ended queue) is used to store indices of elements from `nums`. It has two main properties in this algorithm:
- **Maintaining the Window:**  
  Indices that fall outside the current window (`index - k + 1`) are removed from the front.
- **Maintaining Decreasing Order:**  
  The deque holds indices such that the corresponding values in `nums` are in decreasing order. This ensures that the element at the front is always the maximum for the current window.

### 3. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Empty Check:**  
     If `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
   - **Variables:**  
     - `results`: List to store the maximum for each window.
     - `index_q`: A deque to store indices of the potential maximum elements.

2. **Processing Each Element (Loop):**
   - **Iterate over `nums`:**  
     The `for` loop processes each element along with its index.
   
   - **Remove Out-of-Window Indices:**  
     ```python
     if index_q and index_q[0] < index - k + 1:
         index_q.popleft()
     ```
     This step ensures that any index at the front of the deque that is not in the current window is removed.

   - **Maintain Decreasing Order:**  
     ```python
     while index_q and nums[index_q[-1]] < num:
         index_q.pop()
     ```
     Here, indices whose values are less than the current element are removed from the back. This keeps the deque ordered in a way that the highest value’s index is at the front.

   - **Append Current Index:**  
     The current index is appended to the deque:
     ```python
     index_q.append(index)
     ```

   - **Record the Maximum:**  
     Once the window has reached its full size (`index >= k - 1`), the element at the front of the deque (which is the maximum) is added to `results`:
     ```python
     results.append(nums[index_q[0]])
     ```

3. **Return the Result:**
   - The function returns the list `results` containing the maximum values for each sliding window.

### 4. Efficiency

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The algorithm runs in O(n) time since each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  The space used by the deque is O(k), which is efficient for this type of sliding window problem.

## Other Important Info

### Key Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **`collections.deque`:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Provides a double-ended queue that allows appending and popping from both ends in O(1) time.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Efficiently tracks indices of elements to determine the maximum in the current window.

- **Sliding Window Technique:**
  - **Concept:**  
    Involves moving a window across the array to calculate values (in this case, maximums) without reprocessing the entire window each time.
  - **Benefits:**  
    Reduces redundant computations, leading to an efficient solution.

- **While Loop:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Used here to remove indices from the deque that are no longer useful (either out of the window or not larger than the current element).
