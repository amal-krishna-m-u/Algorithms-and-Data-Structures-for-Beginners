# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters â€“ Detailed Explanation

This code snippet solves the problem of finding the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` that does not contain any repeating characters. For the example `s = "pwwkew"`, the expected output is `3` (the substring `"wke"` is one such longest substring).

## Code Listing

```python
s = "pwwkew"
# Expected output: 3

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) -> int:
    # If the string has less than 2 characters, return its length
    if len(s) < 2:
        return len(s)
    
    character = set()          # Set to store unique characters in the current window
    left = 0                   # Left pointer of the sliding window
    right = 0                  # Right pointer of the sliding window
    max_len = float('-inf')    # Initialize maximum length to negative infinity
    
    # Iterate with the right pointer over the string
    while right < len(s):
        # If the current character is already in the set, there is a repetition
        if s[right] in character:
            # Move the left pointer rightward until the repeating character is removed
            while s[right] != s[left]:
                character.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            # Remove the repeated character at the left pointer and move left pointer once more
            character.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        
        # Update the maximum length with the current window size
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
        
        # Add the current character to the set and move the right pointer forward
        character.add(s[right])
        right += 1
    
    return max_len

print("output:", lengthOfLongestSubstring(s))
```

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Determine the length of the longest substring without any repeating characters.
  
- **Example:**  
  For the input `s = "pwwkew"`, one of the longest substrings without repeating characters is `"wke"`, which has a length of `3`.

### 2. Key Variables and Initialization

- **`character` (set):**  
  Used to keep track of the unique characters in the current sliding window.
  
- **Pointers:**  
  - `left`: Marks the start of the current window.  
  - `right`: Marks the end of the current window.
  
- **`max_len`:**  
  Holds the maximum length of a valid substring found so far. It is initialized to negative infinity to ensure any valid window will be larger.

### 3. The Sliding Window Technique

The sliding window approach is used to expand and contract a window over the string such that it always contains unique characters.

1. **Expanding the Window:**
   - The `right` pointer moves across the string, adding the current character to the set.
   - **Before Adding:**  
     If the character at `s[right]` is already in the set, a duplicate is encountered.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - When a duplicate is found (`s[right] in character`), the code enters a `while` loop.
   - **Inside the Loop:**
     - The loop removes characters from the left side of the window until the duplicate character (matching `s[right]`) is removed.
     - This is done by:
       - Removing `s[left]` from the set.
       - Incrementing the `left` pointer to narrow the window.
   - After the inner loop, the duplicate character is removed and the `left` pointer is moved one extra step to ensure the window no longer contains the duplicate.

3. **Updating the Maximum Length:**
   - After ensuring that the current window has all unique characters, the window size is calculated as `right - left + 1`.
   - The `max_len` is updated using the `max()` function to store the largest window size encountered.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The loop continues until the `right` pointer has processed all characters.
   - Finally, `max_len` is returned, which represents the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### 4. Edge Cases

- **Short Strings:**  
  If the string length is less than 2, the function immediately returns the string's length since any string with 0 or 1 character is unique by default.

## Other Important Info

### Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **`set` Data Structure:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    A set stores unique items and provides O(1) average time complexity for membership checks.
  - **Use Case:**  
    It is used to quickly determine whether a character is already present in the current substring.

- **Sliding Window Technique:**
  - **Concept:**  
    This technique involves using two pointers to create a window over the data and dynamically adjusting the window size based on certain conditions (in this case, uniqueness of characters).
  - **Benefits:**  
    It efficiently handles problems that require checking contiguous subarrays or substrings, reducing the need for nested loops.

- **`max()` Function:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Returns the maximum of the provided arguments.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Updates `max_len` by comparing the current window size with the maximum size found so far.

- **While Loop:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Continuously removes characters from the left until the duplicate is removed.
  - **Benefit:**  
    Ensures the current window always satisfies the condition of having unique characters.
