# Contains Nearby Duplicate â€“ Detailed Explanation

This function determines whether there are any duplicate values in the list `nums` such that the two indices of the duplicate values are at most `k` apart. It achieves this by maintaining a sliding window (implemented as a set) of the last `k` elements seen in the array.

## Code Listing

```python
def containsNearbyDuplicate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
    # Initialize an empty set to represent the sliding window
    window = set()
    left = 0  # Left pointer for the window

    # Iterate through each index with the right pointer
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        # If the window size exceeds k, remove the element at the left pointer
        if right - left > k:
            window.remove(nums[left])
            left += 1
        
        # If the current element is already in the window, a nearby duplicate exists
        if nums[right] in window and right - left <= k:
            return True
        
        # Add the current element to the window
        window.add(nums[right])
    
    # No nearby duplicate was found
    return False

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
k = 3
# Expected output: True

print("output:", containsNearbyDuplicate(nums, k))
```

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Check if there exists at least one pair of duplicate elements in `nums` such that the distance (difference in indices) between them is no greater than `k`.

- **Example:**  
  For `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]` and `k = 3`, the duplicate value `1` appears at indices `0` and `3`. Since `3 - 0 = 3` (which is within the allowed range), the function returns `True`.

### 2. Core Idea and Approach

- **Sliding Window Technique:**  
  The algorithm uses a sliding window of size at most `k` to keep track of the most recent elements encountered. As you move through the array with a `right` pointer, you add new elements to the window. If the window grows larger than `k`, the oldest element (pointed by `left`) is removed.

- **Using a Set:**  
  The set `window` is used to store the elements in the current window. Since sets offer O(1) average time complexity for membership tests, checking if an element is already in the window is very efficient.

### 3. Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialization:**  
   - `window`: An empty set to store elements from the current window.
   - `left`: A pointer initialized at index `0` to track the start of the current window.

2. **Iteration:**  
   - The `for` loop iterates through the array with `right` as the index for the current element.
   - **Window Size Check:**  
     If the size of the window (`right - left`) becomes greater than `k`, the element at `nums[left]` is removed from the window, and `left` is incremented. This ensures that the window always covers at most `k + 1` indices.
   - **Duplicate Check:**  
     The code checks if the current element `nums[right]` is already in the window. If it is, this means that a duplicate exists within the range of `k` indices, and the function returns `True`.
   - **Add Element to Window:**  
     If no duplicate is found, `nums[right]` is added to the window.

3. **Return Statement:**  
   - If the loop completes without finding any nearby duplicate, the function returns `False`.

### 4. How It Works for the Example

- **Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]`, `k = 3`
  - **Iteration 1:**  
    - `right = 0`, window becomes `{1}`.
  - **Iteration 2:**  
    - `right = 1`, window becomes `{1, 2}`.
  - **Iteration 3:**  
    - `right = 2`, window becomes `{1, 2, 3}`.
  - **Iteration 4:**  
    - `right = 3`, check finds that `1` is already in the window, so the function returns `True`.

## Other Important Info

### Key Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **Set Data Structure:**  
  - **Purpose:**  
    Stores unique elements and provides fast membership testing (O(1) on average).
  - **Use Case:**  
    It is used here to efficiently determine whether a duplicate element exists in the current sliding window.

- **Sliding Window Technique:**  
  - **Concept:**  
    Maintains a "window" of elements (in this case, of size up to `k`) that moves over the array.  
  - **Benefit:**  
    Allows efficient handling of contiguous subarray problems by avoiding reprocessing the entire array for each new element.

- **Two-Pointer Approach:**  
  - **Usage:**  
    The `left` and `right` pointers are used to manage the boundaries of the sliding window.  
  - **Advantage:**  
    This minimizes the number of operations needed to update the window as it slides through the array.
