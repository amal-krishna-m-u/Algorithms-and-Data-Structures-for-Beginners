# Number of Subarrays Meeting Threshold â€“ Detailed Explanation

This code solves the problem of counting the number of contiguous subarrays of length `k` within an array whose average value is greater than or equal to a specified threshold. Instead of computing the average for each subarray, the code compares the subarray sum to the target sum, which is `k * threshold`.

## Code Listing

```python
def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int], k: int, threshold: int) -> int:
    left = 0
    # Compute the sum of the first window of size k
    curr_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    # Calculate the target sum based on the threshold average
    target_sum = k * threshold

    # Initialize count. The first window is counted if its sum is >= target_sum.
    count = 1 if curr_sum >= target_sum else 0
    size = len(arr)
    
    # Slide the window across the array from index k to the end
    for right in range(k, size):
        # Update the current sum by adding the new element and subtracting the left-most element of the previous window
        curr_sum += arr[right] - arr[left]
        
        # If the updated window's sum is at least target_sum, increment count
        if curr_sum >= target_sum:
            count += 1
        
        # Move the left pointer to slide the window
        left += 1
    
    return count

# Input:
arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 8]
k = 3
threshold = 4

# Expected Output: 3
```

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Count the number of contiguous subarrays of length `k` that have an average greater than or equal to `threshold`.
  
- **Key Insight:**  
  Instead of calculating the average for each subarray, multiply the threshold by `k` to get a target sum. A subarray meets the condition if its sum is greater than or equal to this target.

### 2. Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Window Setup:**
   - **Left Pointer:**  
     The variable `left` is initialized to `0` to mark the start of the current window.
   - **Current Sum:**  
     The first subarray (or window) of size `k` is processed using:
     ```python
     curr_sum = sum(arr[:k])
     ```
   - **Target Sum:**  
     The threshold condition is converted into a sum condition:
     ```python
     target_sum = k * threshold
     ```
   - **Count Initialization:**  
     If the first window's sum (`curr_sum`) meets or exceeds `target_sum`, `count` is initialized to `1`; otherwise, it starts at `0`.

2. **Sliding the Window:**
   - **Loop:**  
     A `for` loop runs from `right = k` to `right = len(arr) - 1`, effectively sliding the window one element at a time.
   - **Update the Sum Efficiently:**  
     For each new element at `arr[right]`, update the current sum by adding this element and subtracting the element at the start of the previous window (`arr[left]`):
     ```python
     curr_sum += arr[right] - arr[left]
     ```
   - **Checking the Condition:**  
     If the updated sum is at least `target_sum`, increment the `count`:
     ```python
     if curr_sum >= target_sum:
         count += 1
     ```
   - **Move the Window:**  
     Increment the `left` pointer to slide the window forward:
     ```python
     left += 1
     ```

3. **Final Result:**
   - After processing all windows, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of valid subarrays.

### 3. Example Walkthrough

For the input `arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 8]`, `k = 3`, and `threshold = 4`:
- **Target Sum Calculation:**  
  `target_sum = 3 * 4 = 12`.
- **First Window ([2, 2, 2]):**  
  Sum = 6 (does not meet the condition).
- **Second Window ([2, 2, 2]):**  
  Sum = 6 (still below target).
- **Third Window ([2, 2, 5]):**  
  Sum = 9 (below target).
- **Fourth Window ([2, 5, 5]):**  
  Sum = 12 (meets condition, count becomes 1).
- **Fifth Window ([5, 5, 5]):**  
  Sum = 15 (meets condition, count becomes 2).
- **Sixth Window ([5, 5, 8]):**  
  Sum = 18 (meets condition, count becomes 3).

Thus, the expected output is `3`.

## Other Important Info

### Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **`sum()` Function:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Computes the sum of a slice of the array.  
  - **Use Case:**  
    Used to calculate the sum of the first `k` elements efficiently.

- **Sliding Window Technique:**
  - **Concept:**  
    A method to move through the array with a fixed-size window and update the result incrementally without recalculating the sum from scratch for each new window.
  - **Benefits:**  
    Efficiently reduces time complexity to O(n) since each element is added and subtracted only once.

- **Efficient Sum Updates:**
  - **How:**  
    Instead of computing the sum for each new window from scratch, the code updates the current sum by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the new incoming element.
