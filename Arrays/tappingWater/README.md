# Container With Most Water – Detailed Explanation

This code snippet calculates the maximum amount of water that can be trapped between two vertical lines represented by their heights. The problem is commonly known as the "Container With Most Water" problem. The goal is to find two lines such that, together with the x-axis, they form a container that holds the most water.

## Code Listing

```python
height = [8, 7, 2, 1]

def tappingWater(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0
    
    while left < right:
        # Calculate the area using the distance between pointers and the smaller height
        area = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
        print("area:", area)
        
        # Update max_area if the current area is larger
        max_area = max(area, max_area)
        
        # Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward
        if height[right] < height[left]:
            right -= 1
        else:
            left += 1
            
    return max_area

print("Max water:", tappingWater(height))
```

## Detailed Explanation

### Overview

- **Input:**  
  A list `height` representing the height of vertical lines (e.g., `[8, 7, 2, 1]`).
- **Output:**  
  The maximum area of water that can be contained between two lines.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Pointer Initialization:**
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are set at the beginning and end of the list, respectively.
   - **Reason:**  
     This allows us to consider the widest container initially.

2. **Area Calculation:**
   - Within a `while` loop that runs until the two pointers meet, the area is calculated using:
     ```python
     area = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - **Width:** The distance between the two pointers (`right - left`).
     - **Height:** Determined by the shorter of the two lines (`min(height[left], height[right])`), because water cannot exceed the height of the shorter line.
   - The calculated area is then printed and compared with the current maximum area (`max_area`), updating it if the current area is larger.

3. **Pointer Adjustment:**
   - After calculating the area, the algorithm decides which pointer to move:
     - **If `height[right]` is less than `height[left]`:**  
       The right pointer is moved one step to the left (`right -= 1`).
     - **Otherwise:**  
       The left pointer is moved one step to the right (`left += 1`).
   - **Why do we adjust the pointers this way?**
     - **Reducing the width:**  
       As the pointers move closer, the container's width decreases, so to potentially increase the area, a taller line must be found.
     - **Optimizing the height:**  
       Moving the pointer that points to the shorter line gives a chance of finding a taller line, which may increase the area even with a narrower width.
   
4. **Return Statement:**
   - When the pointers meet, the loop ends, and the function returns `max_area`, which is the maximum area calculated during the process.

## Other Important Info

### Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **`min()` Function**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Returns the smaller of the given arguments.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Used to determine the effective height of the container since the water level is limited by the shorter line.
  
- **`max()` Function**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Returns the larger of the given values.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Helps update the maximum area found so far by comparing the current area with the previous maximum.
  
- **Two-Pointer Technique**
  - **Purpose:**  
    An efficient strategy to solve problems involving sorted or indexed data by using two indices to traverse the data from both ends.
  - **Use Case:**  
    In this problem, the two-pointer method reduces the number of comparisons needed by intelligently moving pointers based on the heights, achieving a time complexity of O(n).

- **While Loop**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Continues processing until the two pointers meet, ensuring every possible container is considered in an efficient manner.
