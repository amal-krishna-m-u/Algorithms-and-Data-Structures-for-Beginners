# Subarray Product Less Than K – Detailed Explanation

This code snippet solves the problem of finding the number of contiguous subarrays within an array whose product is less than a specified target value `k`. It uses the **sliding window** approach to efficiently manage the product of the current window and adjust its size to count valid subarrays.

## Code Listing

```python
nums = [10,9,10,4,3,8,3,3,6,2,10,10,9,3]
k = 19
# Expected output: 18

def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(nums, k):
    left = 0                # Start index of the sliding window
    curr_product = 1        # Product of elements in the current window
    subarray_len = 0        # Total count of valid subarrays
    size = len(nums)
    
    # If k is 1 or less, no positive product can be less than k
    if k <= 1:
        return 0
    
    # Expand the window with the right pointer
    for right in range(size):
        curr_product *= nums[right]
        
        # Shrink the window from the left if the product exceeds or equals k
        while curr_product >= k and right >= left:
            curr_product //= nums[left]
            left += 1
        
        # Count all valid subarrays ending at 'right'
        subarray_len += right - left + 1
        
    return subarray_len

print("output:", numSubarrayProductLessThanK(nums, k))
```

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Determine the number of contiguous subarrays in which the product of the elements is less than `k`.
  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `nums`: A list of positive integers (e.g., `[10,9,10,4,3,8,3,3,6,2,10,10,9,3]`).
  - `k`: A positive integer target (e.g., `19`).
  
- **Output:**  
  An integer representing the count of valid subarrays. For the given example, the expected result is `18`.

### 2. The Sliding Window Technique

The algorithm leverages the sliding window approach to maintain and adjust the product of a subarray as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Pointers:**  
     - `left`: Marks the start of the sliding window (initialized to `0`).
     - `right`: Iterates over the array, marking the end of the current window.
   - **Variables:**  
     - `curr_product`: Stores the product of the current window, initialized to `1`.
     - `subarray_len`: Counts the total number of valid subarrays found.
   - **Edge Case:**  
     If `k` is less than or equal to `1`, the function immediately returns `0` since no product of positive numbers can be less than or equal to `1` (when `k == 1`).

2. **Expanding the Window:**
   - A `for` loop with the variable `right` is used to iterate through `nums`.
   - At each iteration, the current element `nums[right]` is multiplied into `curr_product`.

3. **Contracting the Window:**
   - While the `curr_product` is greater than or equal to `k`, the window is too "heavy" (i.e., its product is too large).  
   - The code enters a `while` loop that:
     - Divides `curr_product` by `nums[left]` (using floor division `//=` to update the product).
     - Moves the `left` pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window from the left.
   - This process continues until the product of the current window becomes less than `k`.

4. **Counting Valid Subarrays:**
   - After adjusting the window, all subarrays ending at the current `right` index with a start index from `left` to `right` have a product less than `k`.
   - The number of these subarrays is given by `right - left + 1` and is added to `subarray_len`.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - Once the loop completes, `subarray_len` holds the total count of valid subarrays, which is returned.

### 3. Why the Window is Adjusted This Way

- **Expanding the Window:**  
  As the `right` pointer moves, the window includes more elements, and `curr_product` is updated to reflect the product of these elements.
  
- **Contracting the Window:**  
  When `curr_product` becomes too high (i.e., greater than or equal to `k`), the window is contracted from the left to remove elements, thus reducing the product. This ensures that we only count subarrays whose product is less than `k`.

- **Counting Subarrays:**  
  Once the window is adjusted, every subarray ending at the current index (with varying starting positions from `left` to `right`) is valid. Therefore, `right - left + 1` gives the total number of new valid subarrays.

## Other Important Info

### Inbuilt Functions and Concepts

- **Sliding Window Technique:**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Efficiently processes subarrays by dynamically adjusting the window’s boundaries without having to re-compute the product from scratch each time.
  - **Benefits:**  
    Reduces time complexity by ensuring each element is processed a limited number of times (approximately O(n)).

- **Floor Division (`//=`):**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Divides the current product by a number and assigns the integer result back to `curr_product`.
  - **Use Case:**  
    Essential for correctly updating the product when shrinking the window.

- **Conditional Looping (`while` loop):**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Allows the algorithm to continuously adjust the window until the product condition (`curr_product < k`) is met.
  - **Benefit:**  
    Ensures that the window is minimized to only include elements that contribute to a valid subarray.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The check `if k <= 1` is crucial because if `k` is 1 (or less), then no positive product of elements can satisfy the condition, and the function correctly returns `0`.
